#### Transpose 1D array to column vector

```python
# Assuming mean_open and mean_high are already defined
mean_array = np.array([mean_open, mean_high])
column_vector = mean_array.reshape(-1, 1)
print(column_vector)
```

## Notes

General note. I'm trying to treat the folder structure a bit like a to-do list. I find this helps me stay focused.

### desc_exp_1.ipynb

This file is an initial exploration. Goal will be to export to Python and then import specific functions later for analysis.

- Analysis level -> descriptive statistics
- Descriptives are added to a dictionary such that it is easy to call them later as groups
- Descriptives also defined as arrays so we can play around later
- Because values for Volume are so much higher than other values they're excluded until they're needed later
-
